# Neo's Showcase

Most of my work is not strictly open source but I am including some code here to view some things I am proud of.

- botty - Botty is a fully automated trading bot I created to implement trading strategies which I developed and back tested. The repo is private but but the botty folder can give you an idea.
- modling - This folder is for notebooks where I create some models
